JAVA sample programs to understand better..

Java Collections 
List
    Create list.
    Add elements to list.
    Find elements in list.
    Check if list contain element.
    Find size of list.
    Sort list.
    Iterate list.
    Remove elements from list.
    Remove all elements from list.    

Set
    HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
    HashSet contains unique elements only.
    HashSet allows null value.
    HashSet class is non synchronized.
    HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
    HashSet is the best approach for search operations.

HashSet: If you donâ€™t want to maintain insertion order but want to store unique objects. 
LinkedHashSet: If you want to maintain the insertion order of elements then you can use LinkedHashSet. 
TreeSet: If you want to sort the elements according to some Comparator then use TreeSet.
